The Student Information System (SIS) is a web application developed to streamline the management of student data within educational institutions. Designed with an intuitive dashboard, this system allows administrators and authorized users to access, manage, and maintain student records, department details, courses, users, and settings. The system ensures efficient data handling and an organized approach to student information management.
After entering in to the system, the admin is greeted by this page, which is called the dashboard. As an overview of the system records, the Total Numbers of Enrolled Students and Faculty are shown on this page.

This page can be found under the Academic menu under Academic Year. The academic year, often known as the school year, is listed and administered here.

This page is under Academic navigation, Level and Section. You can add, update, and remove grade levels and sections here.

The list of advisers, together with their handled grade level and section, is displayed on the faculty page. Here, a teacher's adviser is chosen by the administration.
